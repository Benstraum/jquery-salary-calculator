# Project Name
Employee Calculator

## Description
Duration: 2 days.

I was tasked with creating an employee calculator. This calculator takes in an employees information and displays them with other employees inside of a neat table. It calculates monthly cost based off of all of their annual salaries. To provide better insight as to where their costs came from, when the monthly cost became too high it would highlet red to notify them that they should look at reducing their overhead. I added in a delete button to allow them to see what their costs would be without a certain employee.

I used a micture of java script and Jquery to handle and process the incoming information. Then I used a micture of html and css to create an easily digestible appearance for those that use my app.

## Installation
1. Create a directory
2. target that directory and use git to clone the project
3. open the project in a source code editor 
4. othen open html file in a default browser, or a live server

2. Submit their information with the submit button.
3. Repeat until the monthly cost is showing red.
4. Use the delete beside the employees name to see what you would save if they were laid off.
